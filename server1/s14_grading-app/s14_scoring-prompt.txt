You are an expert evaluator tasked with grading a response based on three criteria: Accuracy, Relevance, and Coherence. Below are the definitions for each criterion and the scoring instructions.

### Scoring Criteria Definitions
-##Accuracy (1-10)
The degree to which the response contains correct, verifiable information supported by evidence or widely accepted knowledge. It should be free from errors, fabrications, or hallucinations and align with the prompt's context.

Score 10: Entirely accurate with no errors or unsupported claims. All information is verifiable and precisely addresses the prompt's requirements.
Score 8-9: Highly accurate with minimal errors that don't impact the overall value of the response.
Score 6-7: Generally accurate with a few minor errors or slightly unsupported assertions.
Score 4-5: Mixed accuracy with some correct information alongside noticeable errors or unverifiable claims.
Score 2-3: Predominantly inaccurate with occasional correct information.
Score 1: Major factual errors or fabrications dominate the response.

-##Relevance (1-10)
The extent to which the response directly addresses the prompt, includes necessary information, and excludes unnecessary content.

Score 10: Answer fully addresses the prompt, is concise, and has very little unnecessary information.
Score 8-9: Response addresses the core of the prompt with minimal tangential information.
Score 6-7: Response mostly addresses the prompt but includes some unnecessary information or misses minor aspects.
Score 4-5: Response partially addresses the prompt with significant omissions or contains substantial irrelevant information.
Score 2-3: Response barely addresses the prompt, focusing mostly on tangential information.
Score 1: Response does not address the prompt or is overwhelmed with irrelevant information.

-##Coherence (1-10)
The logical structure, organization, and flow of the response, including appropriate formatting and clarity of expression.

Score 10: Exceptionally clear, logically organized, and well-formatted with perfect flow between ideas.
Score 8-9: Very clear structure with strong logical flow and appropriate formatting throughout.
Score 6-7: Generally clear organization with a few awkward transitions or minor formatting issues.
Score 4-5: Somewhat organized but with noticeable logical gaps, confusing transitions, or inconsistent formatting.
Score 2-3: Poorly organized with frequent logical breaks and difficult-to-follow structure.
Score 1: Disorganized, incoherent, or lacks any clear structure.

### Input
- **System Prompt**: You are a helpful and informative AI assistant. Answer questions accurately and concisely, drawing on a wide range of general knowledge. If you don't know the answer, say so.
- **User Prompt**: Explain the key differences between transformer and RNN architectures in deep learning.. -- 
- **Response to Evaluate**: I'd be happy to explain the key differences between Transformer and RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) architectures in deep learning.

**RNN Architecture:**

RNNs are a type of neural network designed for sequential data processing. They are particularly useful for natural language processing, speech recognition, and time series forecasting. The core idea behind RNNs is to capture the temporal relationships between adjacent elements in a sequence.

Key characteristics:

1. **Temporal dependencies**: RNNs use recurrent connections (i.e., weights that connect each output node to its previous input node) to preserve information across time steps.
2. **Memory cells**: Most RNNs, like LSTMs (Long Short-Term Memory) and GRUs (Gated Recurrent Units), use memory cells to store information from previous inputs and update it based on the current input.

**Transformer Architecture:**

Transformers were introduced in 2017 as a breakthrough innovation in natural language processing. They replaced traditional RNNs for sequence-to-sequence tasks like machine translation, question-answering, and text generation.

Key characteristics:

1. **Self-attention mechanism**: Transformers use self-attention to weight the importance of each element in a sequence relative to every other element. This allows the model to focus on relevant parts of the input.
2. **Parallelization**: Unlike RNNs, which require sequential processing due to their recurrent connections, Transformers can be parallelized using multi-head attention and position-wise feed-forward networks.

**Key differences:**

1. **Sequential vs. parallel processing**: RNNs process sequences sequentially, while Transformers use self-attention mechanisms for parallel processing.
2. **Temporal dependencies**: RNNs rely on temporal dependencies to capture context, whereas Transformers focus on local relationships between elements in a sequence.
3. **Computational efficiency**: Transformers are typically more computationally efficient than RNNs due to their parallelization capabilities.

**When to use each:**

* Use RNNs for:
	+ Time series forecasting
	+ Speech recognition
	+ Natural language processing tasks that require temporal dependencies (e.g., sentiment analysis)
* Use Transformers for:
	+ Sequence-to-sequence tasks like machine translation, question-answering, and text generation
	+ Tasks where parallelization is beneficial (e.g., image captioning)

Keep in mind that the choice between RNNs and Transformers ultimately depends on the specific task requirements and dataset characteristics.

Do you have any further questions or would you like me to elaborate on any of these points?

### Instructions
1. Evaluate the response based on the three criteria.
2. Assign a score from 1 to 10 for each criterion.
3. Provide a brief justification for each score.
4. If a criterion is not applicable (e.g., no suggestions requested), state this in the justification and assign a 0/10.
5. Format the output as follows:

### Evaluation for Response

**Accuracy**: [Score]
Justification: [Your reasoning]

**Relevance**: [Score]
Justification: [Your reasoning]

**Coherence**: [Score]
Justification: [Your reasoning]

**Total Score**: [Total Score]
Overall Comments: [Optional brief summary or additional notes]
